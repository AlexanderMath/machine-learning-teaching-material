    "Consider a function $f:X\\rightarrow Y$ that is unkown to us. Our goal will be to approximate this function. To this end, we have data on the form $D=\\{(x_1, y_1), ..., (x_n, y_n)\\}$ where $x\\in X$ and $f(x_i)=y_i\\in Y$. It is natural to ask \"how good\" a function $h: X\\rightarrow Y$ is at approximating $f$. To this end one could be inclined to define error as  \n",

    "Finding a function $h$ that approximates $f$ then becomes an optimization problem. There is one problem with this approach. One could design a function $h$ that remembers all the points and thus gets $E_{in}(h)=0$. Our goal is to approximate $f$ on all of $X$ and not just in $D$, so this is not what we want. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the data sample $D$ is chosen adversarially we are out of luck. An adversary could choose the same $(x_i, y_i)$ $N$ times, and it would be impossible to say something that we would be sure works on all of $X$. To handle this problem we assume the data is i.i.d. for some joint probability distribution $P(x,y)$. The goal now becomes to minimize the expected error under the joint probability distribution\n",

In this case we say the hypothesis generalizes to outside the training data. \n",

    "That idea did not really work out that well. The output is very noisy. One possible explanation is that the encoded data is not evenly distributed in the low dimensional space. The low dimensional space is very sparse. Thus, random vectors in this low dimensional space are very unlikely to follow the encoded data distribubtion (the distribution of data points in the low dimensional space). \n",

    "There are two perspectives on Variational AutoEncoders [..]. The one has a nicer mathematical justification for what we do. The perspective taken in this note is the less math savy, that focuses more on neural networks. Here, we attempt to force the distribution of the latent space to behave like a distribution we choose. Usually we use standard normal distributions. It is then trivial to sample from the latent space, because we forced it to behave like a gaussian. See the following for a visualization\n",

This is done by making the encoder output vectors $\\mu,\\sigma^2\\in \\mathbb{R}^h$ that contain the mean and variance of $h$ normal distributions. Different samples of this distribution is then feed the decoder which attempts to minimize reconstruction error like a normal autoencoder. \n",

The hope is that by sampling $D_{test}=x_1,..,x_n\\sim p_{d}$ and $z_1,...,z_n\\sim p_g$ we can estimate $p_i(y)$ for $i=d,g$ and $y=x,z$ and thus estimate $D_{kl}(p \\mid\\mid g)$.
